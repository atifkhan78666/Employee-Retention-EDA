# Employee Retention EDA

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Employee_Retention.csv** dataset.  
The goal of this project was to explore factors that may influence employee retention and gain useful insights for HR decision-making.

##Project Overview
- Performed detailed exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data where required.
- Explored distributions, correlations, and patterns in employee retention.
- Visualized results using different plots for better interpretation.

##Dataset
**File:** `Employee_Retention.csv`  
The dataset contains employee-related information such as:
- Demographics  
- Job role and satisfaction  
- Performance ratings  
- Salary and promotion details  
- Retention/attrition status  

*(The exact columns may vary depending on the dataset source.)*

##Key Steps in EDA
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Checked for null values and duplicates.  
   - Handled missing or inconsistent data.  

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Basic summaries (mean, median, mode, etc.).  
   - Distribution of numerical features.  

3. **Visual Analysis**  
   - Histograms, bar charts, and boxplots.  
   - Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships.  
   - Attrition trends based on salary, job role, and satisfaction scores.  

4. **Insights**  
   - Identified key factors correlated with employee attrition.  
   - Noted patterns that could guide retention strategies.

## Tools & Libraries
The analysis was performed in **Google Colab** using:
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn
